The tutorial will aim to demonstrate how to set up a complete project from scratch that uses:

* PNPM as a package manager
* Git and signed commits for source code management
* ESLint with the security pluginfor static analysis
* GitLeaks for hard-coded secrets detection
* Semgrep as an additional SAST scanner
* PNPM to identify vulnerabilities in packages
* PNPM to analyze the dependencies licenses
* Docker to package and deploy the application

The tutorial does not try to automate these things. Instead the goal is for the user to gain some understanding of what different steps in DevOps are, how they make life better and easier and why they should be used when it comes to security.
