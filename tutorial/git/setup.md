Version control is one of the most important things for software development projects.
While it might have been okay not to use it when you were 14 and building your first HTML page, today it is not.

Here are the advantages of using Git:
- You have a version history
- You can collaborate easily
- If you use Github, Gitlab,... you always have a backup
- It integrates with other tools
- You can run automated tasks
- You can manage who has access to what code and who can change code

Git comes pre-installed but it has to be set up.
Configure it to use your name and email address:

`git config --global user.name "<your name>"`
`git config --global user.email "<your email>"`
